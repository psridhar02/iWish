**Project:** Project 04: Full-Stack Wish List Web Application

---

## 📘 Project Overview
**iWish** is a full-stack wish list and product browsing web application that allows users to explore trending items, save favorites, and manage their personalized wish list.  
The app was built with **React.js frontend** and an **Express.js + MongoDB backend**, integrating with the **Fake Store API** to fetch products dynamically.

Users can:
- Register for an account and log in securely (JWT authentication)
- Browse and filter products by category
- Add items to their wish list (“Your name wished for…”)
- View their saved wishes across sessions
- Enjoy a clean, modern, and responsive UI inspired by shopping platforms
